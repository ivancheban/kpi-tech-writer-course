CodeWars supports multiple programming languages. After creating an account, choose your preferred programming language to start solving katas in that specific language. You can switch between languages at any time.

**Understanding Ranks**
![RankingSystem](./img/RankingSystem.png)
CodeWars utilizes a rank system to measure your coding skills. Starting at a beginner level, represented by a higher kyu number (e.g., 8 kyu), you can progress by solving katas and earning lower kyu ranks (e.g., 7 kyu, 6 kyu, and so on). The lower the kyu number, the higher your skill level.
